# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage is intended to assist boot camp students as they go through the prework study of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. The website's goal is to summarize the material and display it in an organized, user-friendly way to simplify study. I used HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript to create this webpage, which aided in my own study of this material.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes under each subject heading. If you'd like a suggestion on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
